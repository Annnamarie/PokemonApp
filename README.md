# AND101 Project 5 - Choose Your Own API

Submitted by: Annamarie Cortes

Time spent: 8 hours spent in total

## Summary

**Pokemon App** is an android app that **displays a random Pokemon with its name and strength. It will also allow you to search and this will pull up the image of the pokemon**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: ðŸ˜­ðŸ’ªðŸ˜¬

## Application Features


The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [x] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [x] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [x] Add a query to the API request
  - The query I added is **Search Feature that user can look up a pokemon by its name and it will return an image and it's strength**
- [x] Build a UI to allow users to add that query


## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is **PokeAPI**.

## Video Demo

Here's a video / GIF that demos all of the app's implemented features:

## Notes

I learned how to use API into the project. I parsed the information to filter what I need which were the name, img, and strength. I originnaly wanted to use Marvel API which called for a private and public key but I kept having issues. I will continue to explore and try to get that to work.
